Hello everyone!

I'm currently looking for participants for my thesis experiment running from the 6th December to the 20th of December. There is a chance of winning a 25 euro gift card which will be given randomly to a lucky participant and there will be some complimentary cookies for all participants. If you are interested in helping me out, or just want a cookie, please read the following:

My experiment involves interacting with an Augmented Reality application on a mobile device (the device will be supplied, so you won't need to use your own). In the application, you will be throwing away various waste items into different bins, as you would in real life. The application will try to teach you a few things about how to dispose of the objects correctly, and guide you to the correct bin(s). After interacting with the application, you will be asked to fill in a questionnaire.

The experiment in its entirety should take no longer than 40 minutes to complete. The experiment takes place on campus in BBG, but the exact location will be sent to you by email.

If you are interested in participating in my experiment, please check out the timetable in the link below.

If you would like to participate but none of these slots work for you, or have any questions, feel free to send me an email.
